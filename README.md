# Neural Network from Scratch (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file for making neural network from scratch.

## Task
The neural network created here is to do the classic task, classifying MNIST digit dataset.

## Architecture
This neural network consists of 3 layers:
* **Input**: `(784 x 20)`
* **Hidden**: `(20 x 10)`
* **Output**: `(10 x 20)`
